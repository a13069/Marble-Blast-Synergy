## Completion Status
This mod is currently unfinished, and the author wishes to continue working on it in the future. The current completion status (as for levels) is as follows:
- The levels themselves for the beginner levels are finished. However, some levels may lack indicators and help texts so they may be confusing to play.
- The vast majority of the levels are unnamed or have a placeholder name. They also lack other information such as descriptions, awesome hints etc. Feel free to make suggestions!
- The awesome times for some later beginner levels are undetermined.
- Only 8 intermediate levels have been made, and they are unstable right now. Some intermediate levels may be changed, reordered, or be relegeted to a later theme in the future.
- There aren't any advanced, expert, or tutorial level being made yet.
